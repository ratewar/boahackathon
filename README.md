# 🧠 DocIQ

DocIQ is an AI-powered documentation assistant that creates **vector embeddings** for your API or project docs, enabling **semantic search** and **natural language Q&A** over your documentation.  

Built with **Next.js**, **Vercel AI SDK**, **Supabase**, and **OpenAI**, DocIQ makes technical knowledge accessible and interactive for both developers and end-users.
